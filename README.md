# Improved-Projective-Dynamics-Global-Using-Snapshots-based-Reduced-Bases

Implementation for position subspace computation for the SIGGRAPH23 [1st place student comptition award winning paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3588028.3603665).

Note that [SPLOCS](https://github.com/tneumann/splocs) is not included as a submodule

Note that, this codes comes with more advanced options to tyloring the computed bases.
