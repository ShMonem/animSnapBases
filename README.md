# Improved-Projective-Dynamics-Global-Using-Snapshots-based-Reduced-Bases

Implementation for position subspace computation for the SIGGRAPH23 [1st place student comptition award winning paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3588028.3603665).

After cloning, you might need to do
```
git submodule update
```
or
```
git submodule update --remote --recursive --init
```

Note that, this codes comes with more advanced options to tyloring the computed bases.
